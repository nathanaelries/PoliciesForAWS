AWS Policies

This is a repository of useful policies for AWS admins.

DenyAllActionsUnlessEnabledMFA.json - This policy allows a user to list all users, manage their own account information, manage their own MFA devices, set, and update their own password. It blocks any other actions unless they've signed in with MFA.
